# Scroll-Text
I learnt about scrollview while creating scrolling text app. It is basically like the article where it has title, subtitle and a description. It has also tasks, coding challenge and homework.

First talks about tasks, In task part it has three tasks add edittext, add scroll view with web link and at last add multiple element in the scroll view. Scroll view support only one element so if we have to use multiple element then we have to use another layout like linear layout, relative layout, constraint layout etc.

The tasks performed is shown below:
